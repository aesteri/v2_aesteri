# Relocating to LA for the Summer

Published on: 2025-06-05

Edited: 2025-09-10

I booked a week's worth of stay at a shady hostel because I thought I could handle it.

I never smelled so much weed in my life...

I came into the summer of 2025, never realizing that my start date for my internship was actually a week earlier than I had expected. I only managed to find out a week before (I had this misunderstanding because all of my friends were starting a week later...)

I knew the right move was booking a hotel, but the LA prices scared me. I searched for cheaper alternatives, and I found a hostel that only cost 23$ a day. What a crazy deal. 

I went to my dad for his thoughts. He was busy at the time figuring out the optimal way to utilize our flight points for my plane ride to LA, but that didn't stop me. 

"Does this hostel in LA look okay?" 

My dad didn't look because he was busy. He did say "it looks fine" though, but he definitely didn't look into it.

I took that answer as a yes, and there it was: My confirmation to stay at a hostel for a week in Compton, LA. 

During this week, I learned the hard way why a 5'2 petite asian woman/young girl (not even 21 years old at the time) should not book a hostel in Compton LA alone. 

I survived, and I'm definitely thankful for all the lessons I learned. It was a once in a lifetime experience.
