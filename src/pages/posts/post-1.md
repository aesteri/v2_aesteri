# My experience in South Korea

Published on: 2025-05-07

When I came to college, I knew right away studying abroad was something I wanted to do. I've heard stories of many friends and peers developing life long international connections. In general, I heard many good things about studying abroad from older figures that I wanted those good experiences for myself as well. However, what really motivated me to study abroad in Korea was my deep connection back to my Korean heritage. 

As a first generation Korean American who was born and raised in America, opportunities to connect with my culture were limited. Until 2019, I was constantly around a homogenous environment with little to no diversity. Despite going to Korean school rigorously and earnestly learning about my culture, I always felt something was lacking. I yearned for a tangible connection to my culture, and studying abroad guaranteed me a great opportunity to go back to my roots for the first time in ten years. So I was set. I was determined to study abroad. 

## Finances

I went into my application process with a mindset to pay NOTHING for my study abroad experience. At this time, I was heavily involved with my university's motorsports engineering team that I was spending everyday up until 2am minimum at the workshop. I had no time to go find a part time job, and I knew the expenses were going to be a burden to my parents. I was confident though. I had already paid for four years of college through scholarship hunting alone. Who was to say that it wasn't possible with study abroad?

To my greatest surpise (not), there was a phlethora of scholarships targeting students trying to study abroad. After a semester of applying to scholarships, I was set. I managed to fully fund my trip to South Korea. 

## Application Process to SNU

My university has a direct exchange program with South Korea's number one university, Seoul National Univeristy(SNU). Because of this, I personally went through a very simple and easy application process. You do have the option to apply directly to the host institution for an exchange program though, which some of my friends did for Yonsei Univeristy in South Korea. 

## Why I chose SNU

Ever since I learned about univeristy, I knew SNU was a prestigious school. My parents and every Korean grew up listening to the stories and rigor of the prestigious "Harvard of Korea." When I found out my university had a direct partnership with SNU, I was sold. I was determined to go to SNU.

## My Experience in Korea 

First, Korea was amazing. I got to see my relatives for the first time in ten years, eat great food, and try on amazing makeup. I was in paradise--until I got homesick of course. Oh! Not to mention, the political climate of Korea during my time there: Martial Law declared, impeachment of the president, and Johnny Somali... AND another impeachment. Despite the chaos that ensued though, I actually had a great time. I got to witness events in the history book so close to my face. I was very intrigued when everything happened. 

The most important thing I got out of the experience, however, was the connections and knowledge I gained that helped me further my career. There were a few things that I feel were critical to career-building

1. **Gaining a Mentor**: During my time in SNU, I met a SNU Phd student/startup CEO who I met once every week. Not only were they a GREAT person that bought me food, they taught me critical networking skills as well as AI fundamentals. 

2. **The SNU name**: The amount of prestige and impact SNU had was definity felt. I got reached out to many top companies in South Korea as a result of putting SNU on my resume (e.g. Samsung o.O)

3. **Networking**: SNU is full of students who are passionate and hard-working. During my time here, I got to meet many wonderful individuals.

## In conclusion

Anyways! That was a fantastic semester in Korea, and I'm glad I'm documenting it even though I'm a semester late haha. Better now than never. Korea was amazing. If you're reading this right now and have the privilege of making a decision, then make sure you take the opportunity! I'm welcome to any questions regarding study abroad :D
